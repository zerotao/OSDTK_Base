OSDTK Base

run "prep.sh" to setup for your project.  This will remove the
descriptive files for the OSDTK poject and add ones fo your project.
These include README AUTHORS NEWS ChangeLog and prep.sh as well as
cleaning up configure.in, etc.

At this point you have a generic GNU "kickstart/base" package.  
You will need autoconf, automake, and libtool installed at a minimum.

There are two schools of thought on how to start the development process for configure enviroments.

1) autogen.sh -- which gets everything started and then runs configure for you.
                 In most cases it might be expected (in development) to run 
                 autogen.sh rather then configure
2) bootstrap  -- which just does the setup stuff and expects you to run 
                 configure.  You will only run bootstrap when you have made 
                 changes to the setup of your project.

I personally don't care either way so I have provided both for your consumption.  Just remove the one that you do not want.

To get started run "autogen.sh" or "bootstrap && ./configure" runs all of the 
GNU Tools to set everything up, it will run autoconf, autoheader, aclocal and 
automake.  As you advance your project you may wish to remove the calls to 
some of these like autoheader.

When you run autogen.sh you will see the following errors which you
can safely ignore:
automake: configure.in: installing `aux/install-sh'
automake: configure.in: installing `aux/mkinstalldirs'
automake: configure.in: installing `aux/missing'
configure.in: 31: required file `aux/ltconfig' not found
automake: Makefile.am: installing `./INSTALL'
automake: Makefile.am: installing `./COPYING'
